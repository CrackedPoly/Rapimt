# Be compatible with diverse devices
Forwarding functions from different devices (switch, iptables, etc.) may 
have different format of configuration: topology, fib, forwarding actions. To 
perform network verification functions on them, we have to be compatible 
with those devices.

So this is a guide about how to adapt to a new device.
## Decide how to get the configuration

## Parsing topology

## Parsing fib

## Extending new forwarding actions
